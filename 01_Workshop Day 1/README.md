# Tool Use Agent - Powered by LangGraph

In the first session, we'll make a simple LangGraph Tool Use Agent to familiarize ourself with LangGraph and the core patterns of Generative AI.

## 🏗️ Task 1 (In Workshop):

Execute the code cells and familiarize yourself with the basic flow of LangGraph.

## 🏗️ Task 2: (Overnight):

Use the boilerplate provided in the notebook to create a Tool Use agent of your own. Take the following steps:

1) Add any of the support tools to your tool belt (or create your own)
2) Create a simple tool-use graph and compile it!

When you're done - make a LinkedIn post and tag us `@AI Makerspace`!
