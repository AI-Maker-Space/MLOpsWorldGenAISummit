Using this criterion, Mount Everest in the Himalayas is considered the tallest mountain on Earth, with its peak soaring to 29,032 feet (8,848 meters) above sea level. \n\nAnother way to consider the tallest mountain is by measuring its height from base to summit. By this measure, Mauna Kea in Hawaii is the tallest mountain, with a total height of over 33,500 feet (10,210 meters) from its base on the seafloor to its summit above sea level.\n\nSo, if we define \"tall\" based on elevation above sea level, Mount Everest is the tallest mountain.
