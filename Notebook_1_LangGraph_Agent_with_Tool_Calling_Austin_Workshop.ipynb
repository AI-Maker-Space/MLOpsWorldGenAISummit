        "\n",
        "LangGraph is a tool that leverages LangChain Expression Language to build coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications that includes cyclic behaviour.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Cycles?\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, we can think of a cycle in our graph as a more robust and customizable loop. It allows us to keep our application agent-forward while still giving the powerful functionality of traditional loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

        "\n",
        "You can read more about it [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/), but there a few features we should be aware of out of the box (taken directly from LangChain's documentation linked above):\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Async, Batch, and Streaming Support** Any chain constructed this way will automatically have full sync, async, batch, and streaming support. This makes it easy to prototype a chain in a Jupyter notebook using the sync interface, and then expose it as an async streaming interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Fallbacks** The non-determinism of LLMs makes it important to be able to handle errors gracefully. With LCEL you can easily attach fallbacks to any chain.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Parallelism** Since LLM applications involve (sometimes long) API calls, it often becomes important to run things in parallel. With LCEL syntax, any components that can be run in parallel automatically are.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Runnables\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to \"glue\" all the various components together, LangChain employs a \"Runnable\" protocol -  [more information available here](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/expression_language/interface/).\n",
        "\n",
        "Essentially, the Runnable protocol allows the library to ensure that components can communicate with eachother in an expected way. It also ensures each component is able to act appropriately in the LCEL framework - part of which enables the behaviours we see above.\n",
        "\n",
